Course Project for ID2214 HT19-1 Programming for Data Science in KTH Royal Institute of Technology


We applied traditional machine learning models such as Logistic regression, Random Forest, LightGBM and also deep learning methods MolCNN which combines Fine tune CNN with pretrained Mol2vec to the problem and employed cross validation to ensure the validity and avoid overfitting, and use AUC as the metric of evaluation. 

We presents the whole modeling process with an emphasis on feature engineering, model selection and model explanation. The final results comes from using Mol2vec features and LightGBM model.
